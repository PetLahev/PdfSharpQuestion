### Trying to get size of an object inside a PDF via PdfSharp

I need to save a chart from Microsoft Excel as a PDF file to get a good quality representation of the chart.
The problem is that the PDF has sometime lot's of extra white space around the chart

I'm unable to find the chart inside the given PDF via PdfSharp, is there anyway how to do that?
